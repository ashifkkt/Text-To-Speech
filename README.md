## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can input text into a textarea.
- **Voice Selection**: A dropdown menu allows users to choose from various available voices.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Upon submitting the form, the typed text is spoken aloud using the selected voice.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**:
    - A container with a heading, a form with a textarea for text input, a select dropdown for voice options, and a submit button to trigger the speech synthesis.

2. **JavaScript Functionality**:
    - **Voice Loading**: The available voices are loaded and added to the dropdown menu.
    - **Form Submission**: When the form is submitted, the text from the textarea is converted into speech using the selected voice.
    - **Speech Synthesis**: Utilizes the Web Speech API to convert text into speech.
